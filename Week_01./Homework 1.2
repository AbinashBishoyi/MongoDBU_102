Download the file products.json from education.mongodb.com. Take a look at its content.

Now, import its contents into MongoDB, into a database called "pcat" and a collection called "products". Use the mongoimport utility to do this.

When done, run this query in the mongo shell:

db.products.find({type:"case"}).count()

What's the result?

> mongoimport --host localhost:27018 --db pcat --collection products --type json --file ~/Desktop/m1022/HW1.2/products.json
> 3
